Description: finite element multiphysics suite - binaries
 The Elmer multiphysics simulation package includes physical models of
 fluid dynamics, structural mechanics, electromagnetics, heat transfer, and
 acoustics, among others. These are described by partial differential equations
 which Elmer solves by the Finite Element Method (FEM).
 .
 Elmer uses METIS (or its free counterpart Scotch) for mesh partitioning, and
 (P)ARPACK, UMFPACK, BLAS/LAPACK, and hypre to solve the sparse linear systems
 resulting from FEM discretization. It includes pre- and post-processors, and
 several examples illustrating simulation of various physical phenomena.
 .
 Elmer's lead institution is CSC in collaboration with Finnish universities,
 research institutes, and industry.
 .
 This package provides the Elmer binaries, including the solver (single- and
 multi-processor versions), GUI, and post-processor.

 fluid dynamics, structural mechanics, electromagnetics, heat transfer, and
 acoustics, among others. These are described by partial differential equations

 This package contains the static libraries and header files for eio, huti, and
 matc, as well as the Elmer solver shared library symlink. These are used for
 developing Elmer, and are not needed to run the software.
