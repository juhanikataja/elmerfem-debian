Original-Source: http://www.csc.fi/elmer/

Notes: I removed the directories mathlibs, umfpack, elmergrid/src/metis, and
 post/src/fonts/TrueType from the upstream tarball because they were either
 non-free (metis) or redunadnt with other Debian packages (mathlibs and
 umfpack; TrueType contains ttf-freefont files).  I also removed the notes
 about those packages from the quote below of the upstream copyright statement,
 which you can see in full in the LICENSES file.
