Source: http://www.csc.fi/english/pages/elmer/sources
 Directories mathlibs, umfpack, elmergrid/src/metis, and post/src/fonts/TrueType
 were removed from the upstream tarball because they are either non-free (metis)
 or redundant with other Debian packages (mathlibs and umfpack; TrueType
 contains ttf-freefont files). Notes about these packages were also removed from
 the quote below of the upstream copyright statement, which you can see in full
 in the LICENSES file. File elmergrid/acx_metis.m4 was removed because some
 consider the QPL non-free. Files misc/tetgen_plugin/plugin/tetgen.* and
 ElmerGUI/Application/plugins/tetgen.h were removed because TetGen uses non-free
 license (MIT license with exceptions regarding copyright attribution and
 commercial use).
 .
 Also few unnecessary files were removed: */*.cache, post/src/*/*.cache and
 misc/tetgen_plugin/*.
 .
 You can use script debian/elmerfem_get-orig-source.sh to repack orig tarball.
